## Android Signing Keystore
For local development, a debug keystore is used which is automatically generated by Android Studio. 
However, for release builds, it's essential to use a secure and unique keystore.

> ℹ️ For now, both release and debug builds are signed with the same debug keystore. This is not a best practice and should be changed in the future.
