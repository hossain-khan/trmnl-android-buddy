# Testing Low Battery Notifications

This document explains how to test the low battery notification feature during development without waiting for weekly checks or actual low battery conditions.

## üß™ Testing Strategies

### 1. **Debug Test Button (Recommended)**

In **debug builds only**, a "Test Notification Now" button appears in the Settings screen under the Low Battery Alerts section.

**How to use:**
1. Build and install a debug APK: `./gradlew installDebug`
2. Open the app and navigate to **Settings**
3. Enable **Low Battery Notifications** toggle
4. Set your desired **Alert Threshold** (e.g., 50% to increase chances)
5. Tap the **"Test Notification Now (Debug)"** button
6. The worker will run immediately with your current settings
7. Check logcat to see the worker execution: 
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep "LowBatteryNotificationWorker"
   ```

**What happens:**
- Triggers an immediate `OneTimeWorkRequest` for `LowBatteryNotificationWorker`
- Uses your current threshold setting
- Fetches real device data from TRMNL API
- Shows notification if any devices are below threshold

### 2. **Monitor Worker Execution via Logcat**

Watch real-time logs to see what the worker is doing:

```bash
# Filter for low battery worker logs
adb logcat | grep -E "LowBatteryNotificationWorker|NotificationHelper|WorkerScheduler"
```

**Expected log output:**
```
LowBatteryNotificationWorker: Starting low battery notification check
LowBatteryNotificationWorker: Fetched 3 devices
LowBatteryNotificationWorker: Found 1 devices with low battery
NotificationHelper: Showing low battery notification for 1 device(s): [Living Room Display]
LowBatteryNotificationWorker: Low battery notification check completed successfully
```

### 3. **Lower Threshold for Testing**

Temporarily increase your threshold to 50% so more devices trigger notifications:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Low Battery Alerts
2. Slide the threshold to **50%**
3. Tap "Test Notification Now"
4. Any devices below 50% battery will trigger a notification

### 4. **WorkManager Inspection**

Use Android's WorkManager inspection tools:

**Via adb:**
```bash
# List all scheduled work
adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler | grep ink.trmnl

# Check WorkManager database
adb shell dumpsys activity service WorkManagerService
```

**Via Android Studio:**
1. Go to **View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí App Inspection**
2. Select **Background Task Inspector**
3. View scheduled and running workers
4. Manually trigger or cancel workers

### 5. **Modify Worker Schedule for Faster Testing**

For local testing, you can temporarily reduce the interval:

**In `WorkerSchedulerImpl.scheduleLowBatteryNotification()`:**
```kotlin
// TEMPORARY: Change from 7 days to 15 minutes for testing
val notificationWorkRequest =
    PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<LowBatteryNotificationWorker>(
        repeatInterval = 15,  // Changed from 7
        repeatIntervalTimeUnit = TimeUnit.MINUTES,  // Changed from DAYS
    )
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember to revert this before committing!**

## üì± Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Device Low Battery
**Setup:**
- Set threshold to 50%
- Ensure at least one device has <50% battery
- Tap "Test Notification Now"

**Expected:**
- Notification: "Low Battery: [Device Name]"
- Content: "Battery level is below 50%"

### Scenario 2: Multiple Devices Low Battery
**Setup:**
- Set threshold to 50%
- Ensure multiple devices have <50% battery
- Tap "Test Notification Now"

**Expected:**
- Notification: "Low Battery: X devices"
- Content: "[Device1], [Device2], [Device3] are below 50%"

### Scenario 3: No Low Battery Devices
**Setup:**
- Set threshold to 5%
- Ensure all devices have >5% battery
- Tap "Test Notification Now"

**Expected:**
- No notification shown
- Log: "No devices with low battery"

### Scenario 4: Network Error Handling
**Setup:**
- Turn off WiFi/mobile data
- Tap "Test Notification Now"

**Expected:**
- Worker retries automatically
- Log: "Network error fetching devices"

### Scenario 5: Notification Permission (Android 13+)
**Setup:**
- On Android 13+ device
- Deny POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission
- Tap "Test Notification Now"

**Expected:**
- No notification shown
- Log: "POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission not granted"

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Notification Channel
```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification | grep -A 20 "ink.trmnl.android.buddy"
```

### Force Stop and Clear Data
```bash
adb shell pm clear ink.trmnl.android.buddy
```

### Check DataStore Preferences
```bash
adb shell run-as ink.trmnl.android.buddy cat /data/data/ink.trmnl.android.buddy/files/datastore/user_prefs.preferences_pb
```

### Manual Notification Test
You can also manually trigger the notification from code for UI testing:
```kotlin
NotificationHelper.showLowBatteryNotification(
    context = context,
    deviceNames = listOf("Test Device 1", "Test Device 2"),
    thresholdPercent = 20
)
```

## üöÄ Production Behavior

In **release builds**:
- Debug test button is **hidden**
- Worker runs **weekly** (every 7 days)
- Requires **network connectivity** (will wait if offline)
- Uses **REPLACE** policy (updates when settings change)

## üìä Verifying Feature Works End-to-End

**Complete test flow:**
1. ‚úÖ Enable low battery notifications in Settings
2. ‚úÖ Set threshold (e.g., 30%)
3. ‚úÖ Tap "Test Notification Now"
4. ‚úÖ Verify worker executes (check logcat)
5. ‚úÖ Verify API call succeeds (fetches devices)
6. ‚úÖ Verify notification appears (if devices below threshold)
7. ‚úÖ Tap notification (should dismiss)
8. ‚úÖ Change threshold and test again
9. ‚úÖ Disable notifications and verify worker cancels
10. ‚úÖ Re-enable and verify worker reschedules

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: No notification appears
**Possible causes:**
- All devices above threshold
- Notification permission denied (Android 13+)
- Notification channel disabled in system settings
- Network error preventing API call

**Fix:** Check logcat for specific error messages

### Issue: Worker doesn't run immediately
**Possible causes:**
- Device in Doze mode
- Network constraint not met (no WiFi/data)
- WorkManager quota exhausted

**Fix:** 
- Disable battery optimization for debug builds
- Ensure network connectivity
- Check WorkManager constraints

### Issue: "Test Notification Now" button not visible
**Possible causes:**
- Running release build instead of debug
- BuildConfig.DEBUG is false

**Fix:** Run `./gradlew installDebug` instead of `assembleRelease`

## üìù Notes

- The debug button only appears when `BuildConfig.DEBUG == true`
- The button is only visible when low battery notifications are enabled
- Each tap enqueues a new immediate work request
- Multiple taps will create multiple work executions (they run serially)
- Test button does NOT affect the scheduled weekly worker
